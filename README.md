# Grip-Arudino-SPI-ADC
Arduino and shift register combinations as an SPI slave to be used with flight sim grips for buttons and axes

# DISCLAIMER
All code should be used at your own risk. I do not accept responsibilty for damages or loss due to implementation of this code. I am not a software engineer, there are more than likely ways that this code can be improved. Please feel free to make suggestions for improvements but as long as things are working as intended I may reserve the right to keep things as is. 

# Arduino with Shift Register
Use the files in "Arduino with Shift Register" if you have connected a shift register in series with your Arduino to expand the inputs. This was orignally designed for the VPForce Shift Register board but should work with other shift registers that use CD4021B shift registers or SNx4HC165 shift registers with an inverted latch signal.

# Arduino Only
se the files in "Arduino Only" if you do not ahve a shift register and are only using the input pins on your Arduino for buttons.
